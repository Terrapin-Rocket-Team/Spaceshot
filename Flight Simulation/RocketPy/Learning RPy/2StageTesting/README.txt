I used the PyCharm IDE, and I uploaded the entire project directory to GitHub, so if you use PyCharm you should be able
to set the 2StageTesting directory as a project

2StageTest is the file I was trying to get 2 stage to work in, others are initial testing files or placeholders for
future work

The data directory contains data provided by RockeyPy about several motors, rockets, etc. which I am using for my
testing code

Some of the ways I tried to pass the end state are in a comment at the bottom of the file, along with a brief
description of the error they caused.

You can test the outputs yourself by changing the value of init to whatever solution you want to try
